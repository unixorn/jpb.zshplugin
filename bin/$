# Lots of command examples (especially heroku) lead command docs with '$' which
# make it kind of annoying to copy/paste, especially when there's multiple
# commands to copy.
#
# This hacks around the problem by making a '$' command that simply runs
# whatever arguments are passed to it. So you can copy
#   '$ echo hello world'
# and it will run 'echo hello world'
