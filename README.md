# jpb.zshplugin

This is a ZSH plugin usable with [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) and other frameworks compatible with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) to easily load some of my tool scripts.

This contains miscellaneous tool scripts and aliases that are not specific enough for one of my more targeted ZSH plugins.

These scripts are personal collection of helper scripts, so while I try to make them useful for other people, they're in a constant state of flux as I make them suit my needs.

## Installing

### Antigen

add `antigen bundle unixorn/jpb.zshplugin` to your `.zshrc`

### Zgenom

add `zgenom load unixorn/jpb.zshplugin` to your `.zshrc` with your other `zgenom load` commands.

### Without using a framework

1. `git clone` this repository, then add its bin directory to your `$PATH`.
2. Add `source /path/to/here/jpb.plugin.zsh` to your `.zshrc` file.

The scripts in this collection don't actually require you to be using ZSH as your login shell, they're being distributed as a plugin compatible with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) because it's convenient for me.

## Other useful ZSH plugins

I also maintain the [awesome-zsh-plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) list of ZSH frameworks, plugins and themes.
