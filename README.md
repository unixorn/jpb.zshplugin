# jpb.zshplugin

This is a ZSH plugin usable with [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) and other [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)-compatible frameworks to easily load some of my tool scripts.

This contains miscellaneous tool scripts and aliases that are not specific enough for one of my more targeted ZSH plugins.

## Installing

### Antigen

add `antigen bundle unixorn/jpb.zshplugin` to your `.zshrc`

### Zgen/Zgenom

add `zgen load unixorn/jpb.zshplugin` to your `.zshrc` with your other load commands.

### Without using a framework

1. git clone this repository, then add its bin directory to your `$PATH`.
2. Add `source /path/to/here/jpb.plugin.zsh` to your `.zshrc` file.

The scripts in this collection don't actually require you to be using ZSH as your login shell, they're being distributed as an [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)-compatible plugin because it's convenient for me.
